You can contribute to this project in several ways:

 * Spotted a typo or other error in code, tutorial, or readme? Let me know by filing an issue or a pull request.
 * See a missing feature? I'm sure a lot could be added, but the aim is not (and never was) to cover all of the functionality available in the Python's argparse library. Please file an issue to start a discussion.
 * Would like to contribute code? Cool. But please first file an issue to start a discussion.
