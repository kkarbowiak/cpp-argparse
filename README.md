# C++ argparse #

The aim of this project is to create a C++ equivalent of Python's `argparse` module. It should be modern, header-only and have no external dependencies. I doubt it will ever be on par regarding features, but it is slowly moving towards getting most often used ones.

The current implementation requires C++17.

This is work in progress. Use at your own risk, or do not use yet.
