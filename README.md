# C++ argparse #

The aim of this project is to create a C++ equivalent of Python's `argparse` module. I doubt it will ever be on par regarding features, but it should get to usable level.

I could probably use the Python module using some bindings, but I want a native implementation.

This is work in progress. Use at your own risk, or do not use yet.
